YOLOv8 Object Detection Project

Welcome to the YOLOv8 Object Detection project! This repository contains code and models to detect objects in images using the YOLOv8 framework. The project is designed to be modular, easy to use, and suitable for beginners and advanced users alike.
ðŸš€ Features

    YOLOv8 Integration: Leverages the powerful YOLOv8 model for object detection.
    Custom Model Support: Easily use your own trained model (yolo11n.pt) or pretrained models.
    Visualization: Draw bounding boxes and labels on images with confidence scores.
    Customizable Thresholds: Set confidence thresholds for precise control over detections.
    Matplotlib and OpenCV Support: Display and save output images with annotated detections.
